## ☁️ Firebase Functions

Tide alerts are sent via Firebase Cloud Functions on a daily schedule using the WorldTides API to a FCM notifications topic.

* `sendTideAlert` is scheduled for **6:00 AM PT daily** using `onSchedule`

### Requirements

* Node.js 22
* Firebase CLI
* Firebase project already initialized

### One-time setup

```bash
cd functions
npm install
```

### Set your WorldTides API key securely

```bash
firebase functions:config:set worldtides.key="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Confirm with:

```bash
firebase functions:config:get
```

---

### Deploy

From the functions directory:

```bash
cd functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```
